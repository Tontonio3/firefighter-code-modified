if (include statement here, like Distance to wall > 15) then

    Do stuff
    
 end if
 
 
 ' Do until example
 ' Do untils are pretty useful if you will only do that once and don't want to go back to main.
 
 Do Until (Sensor = something)
    do stuff
 loop

'For loops are really useful and really easy to set up
'If you need to do something a set ammount of times
'But first you need to define the variable

DIM xVar AS WORD 'variable defined, now just code your for loops and you are good

 For xVar = 1 To 3 ' will loop 3 times
    do stuff
  next
